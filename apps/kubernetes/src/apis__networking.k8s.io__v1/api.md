list or watch objects of kind IngressClass

<h3 id="listnetworkingv1ingressclass-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:<br>  - object.metadata.uid<br>  - object.metadata.namespace<br><br>hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.<br><br>Examples:<br>  2-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br>  4-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')<br>    shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>This is a beta field and is enabled by default via the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.|
|timeoutSeconds|query|integer|false|Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.|
|watch|query|boolean|false|Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.|
|pretty|query|string|false|If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).|

|dryRun|query|string|false|When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed|
|fieldManager|query|string|false|fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint.|
|fieldValidation|query|string|false|fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.|

|» » deletionTimestamp|body|object|false|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.<br><br>Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata|
|» » finalizers|body|[string]|false|Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|
|» » generateName|body|string|false|GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.<br><br>If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.<br><br>Applied only if Name is not specified.

This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.|
|» » name|body|string|false|Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#names|

|ignoreStoreReadErrorWithClusterBreakingPotential|query|boolean|false|if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it|

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|

|» » deletionTimestamp|body|object|false|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.<br><br>Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|

<h3 id="listnetworkingv1ingressforallnamespaces-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|pretty|query|string|false|If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:<br>  - object.metadata.uid<br>  - object.metadata.namespace<br><br>hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space.

This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API.

Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.

<h3 id="deletenetworkingv1collectionipaddress-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|dryRun|query|string|false|When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|gracePeriodSeconds|query|integer|false|The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.|
|ignoreStoreReadErrorWithClusterBreakingPotential|query|boolean|false|if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|orphanDependents|query|boolean|false|Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.|
|propagationPolicy|query|string|false|Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:<br>  - object.metadata.uid<br>  - object.metadata.namespace<br><br>hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.<br><br>Examples:<br>  2-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br>  4-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')<br>    shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>This is a beta field and is enabled by default via the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.|
|timeoutSeconds|query|integer|false|Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.|

|» » deletionTimestamp|body|object|false|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.<br><br>Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|

`GET /apis/networking.k8s.io/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/ingresses`

list or watch objects of kind Ingress

<h3 id="listnetworkingv1namespacedingress-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:<br>  - object.metadata.uid<br>  - object.metadata.namespace<br><br>hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.<br><br>Examples:<br>  2-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br>  4-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')<br>    shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>This is a beta field and is enabled by default via the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.|
|timeoutSeconds|query|integer|false|Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.|
|watch|query|boolean|false|Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.|
|namespace|path|string|true|object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects|
|pretty|query|string|false|If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).|

|» » deletionTimestamp|body|object|false|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.

If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|

<h3 id="deletenetworkingv1collectionnamespacedingress-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|dryRun|query|string|false|When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|gracePeriodSeconds|query|integer|false|The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.|
|ignoreStoreReadErrorWithClusterBreakingPotential|query|boolean|false|if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|orphanDependents|query|boolean|false|Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.|
|propagationPolicy|query|string|false|Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:<br>  - object.metadata.uid<br>  - object.metadata.namespace<br><br>hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.<br><br>Examples:<br>  2-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br>  4-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')<br>    shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>This is a beta field and is enabled by default via the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.|

|» » deletionTimestamp|body|object|false|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.<br><br>Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

|» » finalizers|body|[string]|false|Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|

Ingress controller implementations use this field to know whether they should be serving this Ingress resource, by a transitive connection (controller -> IngressClass -> Ingress resource). Although the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation (simple constant name) was never formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress controllers to create a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress resources.

|» » deletionTimestamp|body|object|false|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.

If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|

<h3 id="listnetworkingv1namespacednetworkpolicy-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:<br>  - object.metadata.uid<br>  - object.metadata.namespace<br><br>hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.<br><br>Examples:<br>  2-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br>  4-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')<br>    shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>This is a beta field and is enabled by default via the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.|
|timeoutSeconds|query|integer|false|Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.|

Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|dryRun|query|string|false|When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|gracePeriodSeconds|query|integer|false|The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.|
|ignoreStoreReadErrorWithClusterBreakingPotential|query|boolean|false|if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|orphanDependents|query|boolean|false|Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.|
|propagationPolicy|query|string|false|Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:<br>  - object.metadata.uid<br>  - object.metadata.namespace<br><br>hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.<br><br>Examples:<br>  2-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br>  4-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')<br>    shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>This is a beta field and is enabled by default via the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.|

Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.<br><br>Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

|» » finalizers|body|[string]|false|Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|

list or watch objects of kind NetworkPolicy

<h3 id="listnetworkingv1networkpolicyforallnamespaces-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|pretty|query|string|false|If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid").

list or watch objects of kind ServiceCIDR

<h3 id="listnetworkingv1servicecidr-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:<br>  - object.metadata.uid<br>  - object.metadata.namespace<br><br>hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.<br><br>Examples:<br>  2-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br>  4-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')<br>    shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>This is a beta field and is enabled by default via the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.|

|fieldValidation|query|string|false|fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present.

|» » deletionTimestamp|body|object|false|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.<br><br>Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

|» » finalizers|body|[string]|false|Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|

If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.<br><br>If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.<br><br>Applied only if Name is not specified.

|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:<br>  - object.metadata.uid<br>  - object.metadata.namespace<br><br>hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.<br><br>Examples:<br>  2-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br>  4-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')<br>    shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>This is a beta field and is enabled by default via the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.|

|» » deletionTimestamp|body|object|false|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.<br><br>Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|

If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.<br><br>If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.<br><br>Applied only if Name is not specified.

|» » deletionTimestamp|body|object|false|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.<br><br>Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|

<h3 id="watchnetworkingv1ingressclasslist-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|pretty|query|string|false|If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression.

<h3 id="watchnetworkingv1ingressclass-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|name|path|string|true|name of the IngressClass|
|pretty|query|string|false|If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid").

<h3 id="watchnetworkingv1ipaddress-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|name|path|string|true|name of the IPAddress|
|pretty|query|string|false|If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:<br>  - object.metadata.uid<br>  - object.metadata.namespace<br><br>hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.<br><br>Examples:<br>  2-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br>  4-shard split:<br>    shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')<br>    shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')<br>    shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')<br>    shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>This is a beta field and is enabled by default via the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.|
|timeoutSeconds|query|integer|false|Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.|
|watch|query|boolean|false|Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.|

<h3 id="watchnetworkingv1namespacednetworkpolicy-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

watch changes to an object of kind ServiceCIDR. deprecated: use the 'watch' parameter with a list operation instead, filtered to a single item with the 'fieldSelector' parameter.

<h3 id="watchnetworkingv1servicecidr-parameters">Parameters</h3>

|Name|In|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|allowWatchBookmarks|query|boolean|false|allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.|
|continue|query|string|false|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".<br><br>This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|labelSelector|query|string|false|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|query|integer|false|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.<br><br>The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|name|path|string|true|name of the ServiceCIDR|
|pretty|query|string|false|If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).|
|resourceVersion|query|string|false|resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|resourceVersionMatch|query|string|false|resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.<br><br>Defaults to unset|
|sendInitialEvents|query|boolean|false|`sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.<br><br>When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan<br>  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"<br>  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced<br>  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.<br>  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the<br>  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment<br>  when request started being processed.<br>- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset<br>  Invalid error is returned.<br><br>Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.|
|shardSelector|query|string|false|shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with \|\| (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:<br><br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')<br>  shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') \|\| shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')<br><br>Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid").

|pathType|string|true|none|pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is<br>  done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the<br>  list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a<br>  match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the<br>  request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring<br>  of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar<br>  matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).<br>* ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to<br>  the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType<br>  or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.<br>Implementations are required to support all path types.|

IPAddress represents a single IP of a single IP Family. The object is designed to be used by APIs that operate on IP addresses. The object is used by the Service core API for allocation of IP addresses. An IP address can be represented in different formats, to guarantee the uniqueness of the IP, the name of the object is the IP address in canonical format, four decimal digits separated by dots suppressing leading zeros for IPv4 and the representation defined by RFC 5952 for IPv6. Valid: 192.168.1.5 or 2001:db8::1 or 2001:db8:aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd:eeee:1 Invalid: 10.01.2.3 or 2001:db8:0:0:0::1

IngressRule represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching IngressRuleValue.

### Properties

|Name|Type|Required|Restrictions|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|host|string|false|none|host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the URI as defined in RFC 3986: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to<br>   the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress.<br>2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.<br>	  Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and<br>	  :443 for https.<br>Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue.<br><br>host can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.bar.com") or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. "*.foo.com"). The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == "*"). Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way: 1. If host is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to Host. 2. If host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http host header is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule.|
|http|object|false|none|http is a HTTP IngressRuleValue, which contains a list of http selectors|

### Properties

|Name|Type|Required|Restrictions|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|defaultBackend|object|false|none|defaultBackend is the backend that should handle requests that don't match any rule. If Rules are not specified, DefaultBackend must be specified. If DefaultBackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the Ingress controller.|
|ingressClassName|string|false|none|ingressClassName is the name of an IngressClass cluster resource. Ingress controller implementations use this field to know whether they should be serving this Ingress resource, by a transitive connection (controller -> IngressClass -> Ingress resource). Although the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation (simple constant name) was never formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress controllers to create a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress resources. Newly created Ingress resources should prefer using the field. However, even though the annotation is officially deprecated, for backwards compatibility reasons, ingress controllers should still honor that annotation if present.|
|rules|[[io.k8s.api.networking.v1.IngressRule](#schemaio.k8s.api.networking.v1.ingressrule)]|false|none|rules is a list of host rules used to configure the Ingress. If unspecified, or no rule matches, all traffic is sent to the default backend.|
|tls|[[io.k8s.api.networking.v1.IngressTLS](#schemaio.k8s.api.networking.v1.ingresstls)]|false|none|tls represents the TLS configuration. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI.|

|---|---|---|---|---|
|egress|[[io.k8s.api.networking.v1.NetworkPolicyEgressRule](#schemaio.k8s.api.networking.v1.networkpolicyegressrule)]|false|none|egress is a list of egress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Outgoing traffic is allowed if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic matches at least one egress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy limits all outgoing traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default). This field is beta-level in 1.8|
|ingress|[[io.k8s.api.networking.v1.NetworkPolicyIngressRule](#schemaio.k8s.api.networking.v1.networkpolicyingressrule)]|false|none|ingress is a list of ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Traffic is allowed to a pod if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic source is the pod's local node, OR if the traffic matches at least one ingress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy does not allow any traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default)|
|podSelector|object|false|none|podSelector selects the pods to which this NetworkPolicy object applies. The array of rules is applied to any pods selected by this field. An empty selector matches all pods in the policy's namespace. Multiple network policies can select the same set of pods. In this case, the ingress rules for each are combined additively. This field is optional. If it is not specified, it defaults to an empty selector.|
|policyTypes|[string]|false|none|policyTypes is a list of rule types that the NetworkPolicy relates to. Valid options are ["Ingress"], ["Egress"], or ["Ingress", "Egress"]. If this field is not specified, it will default based on the existence of ingress or egress rules; policies that contain an egress section are assumed to affect egress, and all policies (whether or not they contain an ingress section) are assumed to affect ingress. If you want to write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes [ "Egress" ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes value that include "Egress" (since such a policy would not include an egress section and would otherwise default to just [ "Ingress" ]). This field is beta-level in 1.8|

APIResourceList is a list of APIResource, it is used to expose the name of the resources supported in a specific group and version, and if the resource is namespaced.

### Properties

|Name|Type|Required|Restrictions|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|apiVersion|string|false|none|APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources|
|groupVersion|string|true|none|groupVersion is the group and version this APIResourceList is for.|
|kind|string|false|none|Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated.

Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.

### Properties

|Name|Type|Required|Restrictions|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|lastTransitionTime|object|true|none|lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.|
|message|string|false|none|message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string.|
|observedGeneration|integer(int64)|false|none|observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance.|
|reason|string|true|none|reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty.|
|status|string|true|none|status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.|

|gracePeriodSeconds|integer(int64)|false|none|The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.|
|ignoreStoreReadErrorWithClusterBreakingPotential|boolean|false|none|if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it|
|kind|string|false|none|Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds|
|orphanDependents|boolean|false|none|Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.|
|preconditions|object|false|none|Must be fulfilled before a deletion is carried out. If not possible, a 409 Conflict status will be returned.|
|propagationPolicy|string|false|none|Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.|

FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.

### Properties

|Name|Type|Required|Restrictions|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|

ListMeta describes metadata that synthetic resources must have, including lists and various status objects. A resource may have only one of {ObjectMeta, ListMeta}.

### Properties

|Name|Type|Required|Restrictions|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|continue|string|false|none|continue may be set if the user set a limit on the number of items returned, and indicates that the server has more data available. The value is opaque and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint that served this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a consistent list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more than a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion field returned when using this continue value will be identical to the value in the first response, unless you have received this token from an error message.|
|remainingItemCount|integer(int64)|false|none|remainingItemCount is the number of subsequent items in the list which are not included in this list response. If the list request contained label or field selectors, then the number of remaining items is unknown and the field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. If the list is complete (either because it is not chunking or because this is the last chunk), then there are no more remaining items and this field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. Servers older than v1.15 do not set this field. The intended use of the remainingItemCount is *estimating* the size of a collection. Clients should not rely on the remainingItemCount to be set or to be exact.|
|resourceVersion|string|false|none|String that identifies the server's internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and passed unmodified back to the server. Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency|
|selfLink|string|false|none|Deprecated: selfLink is a legacy read-only field that is no longer populated by the system.|
|shardInfo|object|false|none|shardInfo is set when the list is a filtered subset of the full collection, as selected by a shard selector on the request. It echoes back the selector so clients can verify which shard they received and merge sharded responses. Clients should not cache sharded list responses as a full representation of the collection.<br><br>This is a beta field and is enabled by default via the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.|

ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

### Properties

|Name|Type|Required|Restrictions|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|apiVersion|string|false|none|APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.|
|fieldsType|string|false|none|FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"|
|fieldsV1|object|false|none|FieldsV1 holds the first JSON version format as described in the "FieldsV1" type.|
|manager|string|false|none|Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.|
|operation|string|false|none|Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.|
|subresource|string|false|none|Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object, or empty string if the object was updated through the main resource. The value of this field is used to distinguish between managers, even if they share the same name. For example, a status update will be distinct from a regular update using the same manager name. Note that the APIVersion field is not related to the Subresource field and it always corresponds to the version of the main resource.|
|time|object|false|none|Time is the timestamp of when the ManagedFields entry was added. The timestamp will also be updated if a field is added, the manager changes any of the owned fields value or removes a field. The timestamp does not update when a field is removed from the entry because another manager took it over.|

ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

### Properties

|Name|Type|Required|Restrictions|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|annotations|object|false|none|Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations|
|creationTimestamp|object|false|none|CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.<br><br>Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata|
|deletionGracePeriodSeconds|integer(int64)|false|none|Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.|
|deletionTimestamp|object|false|none|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.<br><br>Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata|
|finalizers|[string]|false|none|Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.|
|generateName|string|false|none|GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.<br><br>If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.<br><br>Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency|
|generation|integer(int64)|false|none|A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.|
|labels|object|false|none|Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels|
|managedFields|[[io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ManagedFieldsEntry](#schemaio.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.managedfieldsentry)]|false|none|ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.|
|name|string|false|none|Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#names|
|namespace|string|false|none|Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.<br><br>Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces|
|ownerReferences|[[io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.OwnerReference](#schemaio.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ownerreference)]|false|none|List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.|
|resourceVersion|string|false|none|An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.<br><br>Populated by the system. Read-only.

|selfLink|string|false|none|Deprecated: selfLink is a legacy read-only field that is no longer populated by the system.|
|uid|string|false|none|UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.<br><br>Populated by the system. Read-only.

StatusDetails is a set of additional properties that MAY be set by the server to provide additional information about a response. The Reason field of a Status object defines what attributes will be set. Clients must ignore fields that do not match the defined type of each attribute, and should assume that any attribute may be empty, invalid, or under defined.

RawExtension is used to hold extensions in external versions.

To use this, make a field which has RawExtension as its type in your external, versioned struct, and Object in your internal struct. You also need to register your various plugin types.

// Internal package:

	type MyAPIObject struct {
		runtime.TypeMeta `json:""`
		MyPlugin runtime.Object `json:"myPlugin"`
	}

	type PluginA struct {
		AOption string `json:"aOption"`
	}

// External package:

	type MyAPIObject struct {
		runtime.TypeMeta `json:""`
		MyPlugin runtime.RawExtension `json:"myPlugin"`
	}

	type PluginA struct {
		AOption string `json:"aOption"`
	}

// On the wire, the JSON will look something like this:

	{
		"kind":"MyAPIObject",
		"apiVersion":"v1",
		"myPlugin": {
			"kind":"PluginA",
			"aOption":"foo",
		},
	}

So what happens? Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package's DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown type, a runtime.Unknown object will be created and stored.)

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.
